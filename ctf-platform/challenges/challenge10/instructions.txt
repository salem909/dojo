Challenge 10 - Debugging basics (ltrace/strace)

Goal: Discover the expected token by tracing the binary.

Hints:
- /challenge/check compares your input to the token.
- Use ltrace to observe strcmp arguments.

Solve:
ltrace -e strcmp /challenge/check
# type anything to see the token in the trace
# then pass the token to readflag
