# AtlariousPuzzles

A 3D MMO puzzle game inspired by **Puzzle Pirates**, built with **Godot 4.3**.
Players sail a shared world and play minigames at stations to earn rewards.
This repo is the **vertical slice**: client + authoritative server, networked
3D player movement, and one playable puzzle (the bilging match‑3).

## Quick start

You need [Godot 4.3+](https://godotengine.org/download) on your `PATH`.

```bash
# One command — starts a headless server and opens a windowed client.
./tools/host_and_play.sh

# Or run them separately:
./tools/run_server.sh        # terminal 1
./tools/run_client.sh        # terminal 2 (and 3, 4, ... for more players)
```

You should see a 3D world with a green ground and an orange "Bilging Pump"
station. **WASD** to move, **E** near the station to start the puzzle, **ESC**
to exit it.

## Architecture in one paragraph

The **server** is authoritative. Clients send their intended position via
`server_move_input` RPC; the server clamps for sanity and broadcasts a
30 Hz world snapshot back to every client. Puzzle minigame state lives entirely
on the server (`scripts/puzzles/match3/match3_logic.gd` is pure data — no
engine references — so it's easy to unit-test). Clients only render the
results. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the details.

## Adding your Blender assets

See [assets/README.md](assets/README.md). TL;DR: export `.glb`, drop into
`assets/models/`, re-open the project. Replace the placeholder capsule in
`scenes/world/remote_player.tscn` with your model.

## Roadmap

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md). The slice that exists today is the
foundation; the next milestones add ship vessels, multi-player ship crews,
more puzzle minigames (sailing, gunning, sword‑fighting), persistence, and
account auth.
